## **Week 2: Python Programming Basics**

### **Learning Objectives**
- Get familiar with Python installation and setup
- Write your first Python program
- Understand basic syntax, variables, data types, and input/output
- Learn about program structure, comments, debugging basics

### **Recommended Study Plan**
- **Theory (30min):**
  - What is Python? Where and why is it used?
  - Introduction to variables, keywords, data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)[5][6]
  - Making programs interactive: basic input and output

- **Hands-on/Practice (60min):**
  - Install Python on your system ([Python.org](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/))
  - Write and run your first `Hello World` program
  - Practice basic operations: adding numbers, using variables
  - Try simple exercises: swapping two numbers, printing patterns

- **Exercise/Discussion (30min):**
  - Quiz on Data Types, Numbers, Boolean[5]
  - Practice error debugging with typo exercises
  - (Optional) Try coding platforms: [LearnPython](https://www.learnpython.org/) or [GeeksForGeeks Python Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-programming-language-tutorial/)
